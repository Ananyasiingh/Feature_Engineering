Feature Engineering with Outlier Removal :)

This repository contains tools and examples for performing feature engineering, with a focus on outlier detection and removal using various techniques such as percentiles, standard deviation, Z-score, and Interquartile Range (IQR). Feature engineering is a crucial step in the data preprocessing pipeline, as it aims to enhance the quality and relevance of the features used for machine learning models.


Introduction :)
Feature engineering involves transforming raw data into informative features that can improve the performance of machine learning models. Outliers are data points that deviate significantly from the rest of the dataset, and they can negatively impact the performance of models. Detecting and handling outliers is a critical aspect of feature engineering to ensure robust and accurate predictions.

This repository provides Python code examples and explanations for using different outlier detection techniques during feature engineering.


Outlier Detection Techniques :)

Percentile Method
The percentile method involves identifying outliers by comparing data points against specified percentiles (e.g., 1st and 99th percentiles). Data points falling below the lower percentile or above the upper percentile are considered outliers.

Standard Deviation Method
The standard deviation method identifies outliers by calculating the mean and standard deviation of the data. Data points that lie a certain number of standard deviations away from the mean are considered outliers.

Z-Score Method
The Z-score method also uses the mean and standard deviation of the data. It calculates the Z-score for each data point, which represents how many standard deviations a data point is away from the mean. Data points with a Z-score above a certain threshold are treated as outliers.

Interquartile Range (IQR) Method
The IQR method involves calculating the interquartile range, which is the range between the first quartile (25th percentile) and the third quartile (75th percentile). Data points outside a certain multiple of the IQR from the quartiles are considered outliers.
